        <h2>Founding and Early Years (1905-1950s)</h2>
        <p>
            Chelsea Football Club was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub, opposite the current main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road. Chelsea's first success came in 1955, when they won the league championship. The club established itself as a force in English football over the next few decades.

        <h2>1960s-1970s: FA Cup Triumph and European Success</h2>
        <p>
            Chelsea won their first FA Cup in 1970, defeating Leeds United in a replayed final that has gone down in history as one of the fiercest contests ever seen in English football. The following year, Chelsea lifted their first European trophy, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, by defeating Real Madrid in another replay.

        <h2>1990s: The Abramovich Era Begins</h2>
        <p>
            In 2003, Chelsea was purchased by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, ushering in the most successful period in the club's history. The club's financial power allowed them to attract star players and managers, winning their first Premier League title under Jos√© Mourinho in 2005, followed by further domestic and European triumphs.

        <h2>Recent Years: European Glory and Global Success</h2>
        <p>
            In 2012, Chelsea became the first London club to win the UEFA Champions League, defeating Bayern Munich in their own stadium. Further European success followed in 2013, 2019, and 2021. In 2022, Chelsea won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, cementing their place among the world's elite.
